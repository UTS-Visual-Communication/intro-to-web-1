    Rythm
    
    Emil Ruder
    
    Typography involves a number of processes of a very technical character. Type is cast by a highly ingenious technical process, set by machines of complex design, and printed with machines of every kind and size. The machine determines the very nature of typography. The machine functions at its own even tempo; vital and individual rhythms are alien to it. Unlike machine work, manual work, however modest, gives expression to a pulsing, rhythmic movement. The basic difference is well exemplified by a hand-woven and a machine-woven carpet.
     
    Handwriting is full of rhythms: its appearance is determined by effect and countereffect: straight-round, vertical-horizontal, slope-counterslope, curve-countercurve, weight-counterweight, pull-counterpull, upstroke-downstroke, etc. Handwriting can be seen to underlie any good typeface. The process of type-casting (drawing, cutting, punching or moulding, casting) no doubt weakens the rhythm of handwriting but the original written form of the letter should not be completely effaced. A typeface in which something of the original written form cannot be discerned may be rightly called degenerate. The changing pattern of thick and thin strokes in writing with a broad-nibbed pen must be retained in the thick and thin strokes of every typeface, even in sans-serif, so that letterpress can also be enjoyed as a rhythmic pattern.
     
    Lining up letters to form a word, a line, a type area, affords further opportunities for introducing rhythm. These rhythmic values, which the typographer should recognize and appreciate, vary according to word and language. A word with a particular rhythmic charm about its appearance should be made to stand out and become the dominant value of a work. The interword space is the basic means of imparting rhythm to words of different length and weight; narrow interword spacing slackens tension, uniform spacing virtually precludes it, and variety of spacing enhances it.
     
    A mass of type can be rhythmized by unequal leading, by variety in the length of the lines, by the white of blank spaces in break lines, and by grading the size of the type. The dominant black of a large size of type may be enriching in its effect and in many cases acts as a dividing and patterning element which breaks up the type into rhythmically unequal values. Large type, however, should be clearly set off from its surroundings so that it can perform its rhythmizing function.
     
    The width and height of the paper are part of the overall rhythmic pattern and the typographer can position word, line and type mass so as to be in or out of rhythm with the format. With an upright or broadside format a square area of type matter can be imposed in such a way that the two-beat rhythm contrasts with the even measure of the type area. Such contrasts of rhythmic movement afford innumerable possibilities; but the typographer must know in each phase of his work just what rhythms are inherent in it. 
    One the right-hand page there is a structure of uniform proporÂ­tions which is rhythmizied by picking out various elements.
