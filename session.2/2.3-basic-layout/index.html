      <h1>Spacing and layout</h1>
      <h2>Thinking about blocks of content</h2>
      <p>
        We can put space between blocks of type within a type element using line-height, but if we want to create space between different elements i.e. between a h1 and a p, then we need to using padding/margin. Change the width of the browser to see how your elements respond.

      <p>
        The colors and spacing on this page are chosen to make it obvious what is going on with the css properties. Once you have a feel for the box model, restyle this page in more thoughtful colors and box model sizings.
