      <h1>Images and more advanced layout</h1>

      <p>The content of this page is sitting inside a 'div' element that is styled to be 900 pixels wide and have a left and right margin set to 'auto'. Notice how this creates a contrained width that is centered for the rest of the content to sit in.</p>
      
      <!-- move where the image sits in the order of the HTML to saee how this effects layout.-->
      <img src="img/cat.jpg"> 
      
      <p>we can use the same properties we use to layout text to layout images. Also note that the 'width' property can be a percentage value, which becomes very handy when creating more complex *responsive* web pages</p>
      
      <p>We can also do some fancy things with boders and other properties. Uncomment the blocks of css to see some examples.</p>
      
      <p>These are all really basic examples of layoing out content. There is a lot we have not touched on to keep things simple. Your next step is to check out some online guides and tutorials.
