	  <!-- The tags this text is between are calle comments. You can write notes to yourself or other people that view your code here, it is completely ignored by the browser -->

    <p>
      Here us a paragraph with <b>some text made important for the reader (defaults to bold)</b> as well as <i>some text emphasised for the reader (defaults to italic)</i>
    </p>
    
    <hr> 	
    the 'hr' tag defines a thematic change in the content, and defaults to drawing a horizontal rule across the page. The 'hr' tag does not need a closing tag.
    
    <p>The 'a' tag lets you link to other pages. See it used here to link to a HTML reference page. <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp'>click here to view W3School.com's HTML reference page.</a></p>
    
    <p>finally (for today) you can add lists. The following is an unordered list 'ul' with list items 'li'</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>apple</li>
      <li>orange</li>
      <li>pear</li>
      <li>fig</li>
      <li>tamarillo</li>
    </ul>
